My take on a webhook, sent via PHP, received via JavaScript. It is very simple, there is no need to credit.<br><br>
**privolat.php** is the file you should fetch when wanting to send a webhook.<br>
**inject.js** should be injected to the website that you keep opened anytime when you expect someone to fetch the privolat.php file. Edit the file destination on line 1.
